# This is used with Apache WebServers
#
# The following blocks direct HTTP requests to all file types in this directory recursively, except certain approved exceptions
# It also prevents the ability of any scripts to run. No type of script, be it PHP, PERL or whatever, can normally be executed if ExecCGI is disabled.
# Will also prevent people from seeing what is in the dir. and any sub-directories
#
# For this to work, you must include either 'All' or at least: 'Limit' and 'Indexes' parameters to the AllowOverride configuration in your apache/conf/httpd.conf file.
# Additionally, if you want the added protection offered by the OPTIONS directive below, you'll need to add 'Options' to the AllowOverride list, if 'All' is not specified. 
# Example:
#<Directory "/usr/local/apache/htdocs">
#  AllowOverride Limit Options Indexes
#</Directory>
###############################

# deny *everything*
<FilesMatch ".*">
  Order Allow,Deny
  Deny from all
</FilesMatch>

# but now allow just *certain* necessary files:
<FilesMatch ".*\.(jpe?g|JPE?G|gif|GIF|png|PNG|swf|SWF|js|JS|html|HTML|CSS|css|JAR|jar)$" >
  Order Allow,Deny
  Allow from all
</FilesMatch>

IndexIgnore */*


## NOTE: If you want even greater security to prevent hackers from running scripts in this folder, uncomment the following line (if your hosting company will allow you to use OPTIONS):
# OPTIONS -Indexes -ExecCGI
