Phreebooks Small Business Toolkit(tm) - Web based accounting and small business management 

Welcome to the Phreebooks Small Business Toolkit Community

We tried to keep the basic installation as easy as possible. More configuration will be necessary
once the core software and databases have been setup.

Before you begin, you will need to have an existing database, database access information, and a 
webserver running PHP 5 or greater.

NOTE: Phreebooks will install all modules that are present during initial install. If you plan on 
using add-on modules, copy them into you webserver before running the installation script.

1. Since you are reading this, you have already extracted the files from the distribution. Copy the 
files to your webserver to the directory where you want as your Phreebooks homepage. This may be in a 
path below your website root directory.

2. Navigate to the Phreebooks homepage (http://path_to_your_server/path_to_phreebooks/index.php

3. You should see a welcome screen. Read and accept the terms and press Continue.

4. Phreebooks will perform an initial check of the system and alert you if any issues are present.
Issues in RED must be handled before the installation script can continue. Issues in YELLOW are 
cautions and are for informational purposes only. If all ciritical issues have beed resolved, the
information screen will be displayed. Enter the information and press Continue to initialize your
installation and setup the databases.

5. If successful, you will see the configmation page. Read the latest information and press the 'Go 
To My Company' button to acces Phreebooks.

6. Phreebooks creates a list of prioritized ToDo's that need to be addressed to take advantage of it's 
functionality. Consider these part of the initialization as you will receive errors and your system 
will not operate properly if some of them are not completed.

7. Remove or rename the /install directory. This is no longer needed and could allow unwanted access
to re-initialize your system.

Additional documentation is available in the Docs section of the Phreebooks website. Support is
available on the Phreebooks forum at www.Phreebooks.com.
